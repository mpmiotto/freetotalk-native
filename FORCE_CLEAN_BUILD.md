# FORCE CLEAN ANDROID BUILD - Build 128

## Issue: Build Still Using Old Package Name
Despite ALL configuration changes, EAS Build continues to use cached artifacts with old package name `com.mmiotto.freetotalk`.

## Nuclear Option - Complete Cache Clear

### Changes Made for Build 128:
1. **Incremented Build Number**: 124 → 128 (skipping numbers to force fresh build)
2. **Cleared Local Caches**: Removed `.expo` and `node_modules/.cache`
3. **Added Aggressive Cache Clearing**: GitHub workflow now clears ALL possible caches
4. **Force Cache Clear Command**: Added `eas build:clear-cache` before build

### Cache Clearing Strategy:
```bash
# Local caches cleared
rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache

# EAS remote caches
eas build:clear-cache

# Build with maximum cache clearing
eas build --clear-cache --non-interactive
```

### Expected Result:
With Build 128 and complete cache clearing, the manifest should finally show:
- `com.mmiotto.androidfreetotalk.FileSystemFileProvider` ✅
- `com.mmiotto.androidfreetotalk.androidx-startup` ✅
- `com.mmiotto.androidfreetotalk.firebaseinitprovider` ✅

Instead of the cached old values:
- `com.mmiotto.freetotalk.FileSystemFileProvider` ❌
- `com.mmiotto.freetotalk.androidx-startup` ❌
- `com.mmiotto.freetotalk.firebaseinitprovider` ❌

### Firebase Configuration:
✅ `google-services.json` correctly configured for `com.mmiotto.androidfreetotalk`
✅ Only the new package exists in Firebase config
✅ No traces of old package name in configuration files

If this build STILL fails with old package name, the issue is with EAS Build's server-side caching system that may require Expo support to clear manually.
